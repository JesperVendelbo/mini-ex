## The program
My program is a wolf flying around the screen, that interacts with a man once they collide. Upon the collision, the man yells different slurs at the wolf, resulting in the wolf getting scrared and flying in another direction. To begin with i tried making this using the standard libraries, but i quickly ran into some issues when trying to make the wolf bounce once it hit the man both on the sides and above/below, since i could only figure out how to change his direction on either the x or the y-axis. If i changed the direction on both axises, it would result in a loop of it's bounce pattern. Then i saw someone who had made a program using a game library, "P5play", and i figured it was easier for me to use. After downloading and studying the reference for P5play, i managed to make it work after an hour of fiddling with it. 

## Fun?
Olga describes fun and software as "the fun of 'geekiness' wit, the humour and extravagance of mathematical geniuses and their material processes of thinking and making.". She describes this as programmers' humour, but i don't think the humour has to be mathematical, geeky or the likes. That's just used to express the humour, just like making a funny image/meme, or performing a stand up show. In my program i include humor that isn't really geeky in it's core, it's based on a funny news segment on what to do when you meet wolves. This video was made because wolves have come to Denmark recently, and people are freaking out although they're mostly harmless towards humans. I think the program helps display the ridiculousness behind the fear meeting a wolf.
