## Coding Process
I've coded a bit in the past, and although most of my experiences with coding are recent, I tried it out briefly when I was 11 years old. I made random applications in Visual Basic with the help of youtube tutorials. My first application had a button which would close the application, a simple, useless application, but it gave me a vision of the possibilities. This gave me a taste for it, and i started making small applications, mainly for selfish purposes. 

I made a program that looked like a login screen to a game my brother played, to see if it could fool him into giving me his password (I already knew what his password was, and it wasn't to do any harm, I just wanted to see if I could fool him). The application was just 2 text boxes and a submit button, that would save the information to a text file on the computer. It worked, but after making that application I stopped coding because I got bored, or perhaps because advancing to the next level of coding seemed like too much work. 

It wasn't until I was 19 years old and got a job which was to type product descriptions for each product the company who hired me had on their website. There were over 3000 products, and all I was hired to do was combine information from the product, check off some checkboxes and click save. Being lazy by nature, I stopped after only 1 hour, and decided there must be a smarter way. So, I went home, found script tutorials and made a script that would autofill the product descriptions, save it and move on the next product. I then let it run overnight and finished 1 weeks work in less than 24 hours. My employer immediatly saw potential in me, and I eventually started managing and editing all of their websites and learned basic html and css with room for improvement. 

This mini exercise was the first time in a while I've coded scripts, since I've mostly used html and css at work. I wanted to test the options, what variables you could change, and how they could affect each other. That's why I added sliders and changed the pace of the music to match the speed of the rotating text. I wanted to make something you could interact with, but still have a bit of discoverability. I quickly realized however, that using WEBGL for the 3d effects limited my options. I couldn't add text, but I could however add texture to the objects, so I included the instructions for the applications as texture in the objects.

## Coding process compared to writing
Writing code for me reminds me of learning to write in German using proper grammar. You could easily translate the words from Danish to German, but to earn the highest grade, you had to apply the rules of the grammar. You type your sentence, then you see a green curved line under it (Microsoft Word letting you know your grammar is incorrect) and try to fix it using the rules in your grammar book. This reminds me of debugging and using the syntax. An important aspect of grammar is to make sure you express yourself correctly and can't be misunderstood. Just like if you write incorrect code, your program won't run the way you intended it to. 

## Potential and possibility of coding practice
Coding is useful for many things. I've mainly used coding myself to save time, and it has saved me at least 500 of hours of work that I in return could spend on more useful tasks. But coding can also be used to express yourself, whether it be on a website, in a video game or controlling a real-life object i.e. a robot.
