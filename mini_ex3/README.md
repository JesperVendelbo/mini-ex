## The throbber
I've designed a throbber that resembles a clock, with the second/minutes/hour dials. The dials runs at different speeds, and in different directions, to symbolize the undefined time estimate that we usually see in throbbers. The rotationspeed is my unit of time in this throbber, and although I could make it 'timely accurate', it would ruin the purpose of the throbber, and become a simple clock.

This is because all that a throbber tells us, is that something is going on behind the scenes, and most of the time it's due to a video buffering, or a page loading. So you know what you're waiting for, but you don't know how long time it will take, or what the main issue is (slow computer/internet/servers etc.)
